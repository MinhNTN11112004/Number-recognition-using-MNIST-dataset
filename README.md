## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset can be downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The dataset contains:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images

Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the MNIST dataset.
   - Normalize the images for better model performance.
   - Augment the data to increase the recognition ability of the models.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Build a neural network model using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Use layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the model on the training dataset.
   - Use different techniques such as KNN, SVM, FCN, CNN for single digit recognition and YOLO for multiple digit recognition.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
   - Analyze the model's accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Installation
